Install
=============

Install Driftage as a Python 3.7+ package:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    pip install -U driftage

or

.. code-block:: sh
    
    conda install driftage


Now you can build your own :doc:`driftage.monitor`, 
:doc:`driftage.analyser`, :doc:`driftage.planner` 
and :doc:`driftage.executor` using :doc:`driftage.kb`.

There's an :doc:`example <example>` of detecting muscle voltage chenges which that you can follow.

If you want to know more about how Driftage is structured, take a look at the :doc:`dataflow` and :doc:`sequence_diagram` parts of this doc.
