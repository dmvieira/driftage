About
=============

The amount of data and the change in behaviours happens very fast in this interconnected world. 
These repeated changes and the amount of data make machine learning algorithms lose 
accuracy because they donâ€™t know about these new patterns. This change in pattern 
of data is known as `Concept Drift <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift>`_ 
and there are already many approaches for treating 
these drifts. Usually these treatments are costly to implement because they require 
knowledge of drift detection algorithms, software engineering and need maintenance 
for new drifts.

The proposal of Driftage is build a framework using multi-agent systems to simplify 
the implementation of concept drift detectors for dynamic environments.

:doc:`Driftage <index>` is a modular framework where:

:doc:`Monitor <driftage.monitor>`
---------------------------------
Captures data integrated to any framework you want: `Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`_, `Flink <https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/>`_, or even a Python function.

:doc:`Analyser <driftage.analyser>`
-----------------------------------
Analyses data collected by Monitor using a customized Predictor for Concept Drift detection. 
Fast classifiers from `Scikit-Multiflow <https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/>`_ or 
`Facebook Prophet <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/>`_ are great projects for that.

:doc:`Planner <driftage.planner>`
---------------------------------
Observes for new predictions and based on them chooses if the drift is really valid. If it's a real drift, 
it should be sent to the Executor. A custom Predictor can be done for that too, like a voting one or a more 
time-consuming algorithm from `Scikit-Learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, 
`TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_, `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, or others.

:doc:`Executor <driftage.executor>`
-----------------------------------
Receives from Planner new Drifts and sends them to a custom Sink. It can be a `Apache Kafka <https://kafka.apache.org/>`_, `RabbitMQ <https://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_, API, and so on...

:doc:`Knowledge Base <driftage.kb>`
-----------------------------------
Store data collected and predicted by :doc:`driftage.analyser`. Can be queried by 
:doc:`driftage.analyser` for retraining or :doc:`driftage.planner` for predictions.

If you want to know how more how Driftage is structured, take a look at :doc:`dataflow` and :doc:`sequence_diagram`.
